            <p class="one">Iloilo City holds historical significance as one of the earliest Spanish colonial centers in the Philippines, settled in 1566. It was recognized as one of the royal Spanish cities in the country and received the honorific royal title "La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad" (The Most Loyal and Noble City). Iloilo played a significant role in the Spanish Empire's presence in Asia and the Pacific, serving as its last capital in the region.It was also the capital of the short-lived Federal State of the Visayas. Today, the city remains prominent in the country, exerting influence over its history, culture, politics, and economy.</p>

                    <p class="title">IloIlo City</p>
                    <p>The Dinagyang Festival is a religious and cultural festival in Iloilo City, Philippines, held annually on the fourth Sunday of January, or right after the Sinulog in Cebu and the Ati-Atihan Festival in Kalibo, Aklan. As one of the largest festivals in the Philippines, it draws over a million domestic and international visitors each year.</p>

                    <p class="title">Dinagyang</p>
                    <p>The word Dinagyang came from a Hiligaynon word extrapolated from dágyang, meaning “merrymaking.” The festival hosts a celebration of the Santo Niño (Holy Child or Infant Jesus) and the pact between the Datus and the locals after the arrival of Malay settlers and the legendary barter of Panay Island from the natives called Ati. The late Ilonggo broadcaster and writer Pacifico Sumagpao Sudario coined the term in 1977 to differentiate it from Kalibo's Ati-Atihan.</p>

                <h2>PARAW REGATTA</h2>
                <p class="title">IloIlo City</p>
                <p>The Paraw regatta is a race among seafarers on colorful sailboats called Paraws in the straits between Guimaras  Island and the city of Iloilo. The present-day paraw managed to maintain its original design from the sailboats of the first settlers from Borneo who were in search of a peaceful home in 1212 A.D. Surviving the centuries, the paraws have become a vital part of the Filipino seafaring life.</p>

                <p>The first race started in 1973 with the mission to preserve the historic value of the paraws. It is held every 3rd weekend of February at Tatoy’s Manokan, Sto. Nino Sur, Villa, Iloilo City. Today, the event has grown from being a boat race to a festival with various interesting activities.And as Ilonggos take pride of their history and culture, so do the sailors and the boat makers who have inherited a legacy that became synonymous to the birth of a province and the Hiligaynon-speaking region of the country.</p>

            <p>Iloilo has always prided itself in the rich cultural heritage that helped shape the province from its humble beginnings to the thriving and progressive community it is today, and this same heritage has been carefully and vigorously preserved by Museo Iloilo, the repository of the province's history.Museo Iloilo is located on Bonifacio Drive, Iloilo City 5000 Iloilo, Western Visayas. It is a public foundation currently managed by the Iloilo Cultural Research Foundation, Inc. and it aims to maintain and develop cultural education, research and tourism through safeguarding and displays of Western Visayas native culture and history.The museum displays a collection of archeological, historical, ethnographical craft and tribal folk arts relating to Western Visayas. Some of the relics and antiques in the collection were donated by the Ilonggos who are passionate about their province's rich history. The museum also has a collection of priceless cultural artifacts like unique religious images and relics, silver pieces and church vessels that depict the Panayanon religious spirits.</p>

            <p class="aboutp">At JDM Collection we are passionate about cars and are on a mission. We want to develop a resource that provides visitors with the best of information and advice for ‘all things automotive’. Cars today are so much more than mere conveyances that take people from A to B. They represent the cumulative experience and emotion of over a century of discovery, aesthetic design, and engineering. From the earliest steam-powered vehicles, to the emergence of electric propulsion, the motor car moves us not just physically but in our thoughts and our dreams.</p>
