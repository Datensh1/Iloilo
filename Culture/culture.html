            <p class="one">Iloilo City holds historical significance as one of the earliest Spanish colonial centers in the Philippines, settled in 1566. It was recognized as one of the royal Spanish cities in the country and received the honorific royal title "La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad" (The Most Loyal and Noble City). Iloilo played a significant role in the Spanish Empire's presence in Asia and the Pacific, serving as its last capital in the region.It was also the capital of the short-lived Federal State of the Visayas. Today, the city remains prominent in the country, exerting influence over its history, culture, politics, and economy.</p>

                    <p class="title">Dinagyang</p>
                    <p>The word Dinagyang came from a Hiligaynon word extrapolated from dágyang, meaning “merrymaking.” The festival hosts a celebration of the Santo Niño (Holy Child or Infant Jesus) and the pact between the Datus and the locals after the arrival of Malay settlers and the legendary barter of Panay Island from the natives called Ati. The late Ilonggo broadcaster and writer Pacifico Sumagpao Sudario coined the term in 1977 to differentiate it from Kalibo's Ati-Atihan.</p>

                <h2>PARAW REGATTA</h2>
                <p class="title">IloIlo City</p>
                <p>The Paraw regatta is a race among seafarers on colorful sailboats called Paraws in the straits between Guimaras  Island and the city of Iloilo. The present-day paraw managed to maintain its original design from the sailboats of the first settlers from Borneo who were in search of a peaceful home in 1212 A.D. Surviving the centuries, the paraws have become a vital part of the Filipino seafaring life.</p>

                <p>The first race started in 1973 with the mission to preserve the historic value of the paraws. It is held every 3rd weekend of February at Tatoy’s Manokan, Sto. Nino Sur, Villa, Iloilo City. Today, the event has grown from being a boat race to a festival with various interesting activities.And as Ilonggos take pride of their history and culture, so do the sailors and the boat makers who have inherited a legacy that became synonymous to the birth of a province and the Hiligaynon-speaking region of the country.</p>
